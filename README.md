# justpractice-  
Hello! Practicing using git hub and terminals. My first time seeing git hub was while researching for an online resume builder. 
I was very lost when I looked and saw a lot of words that did not make sense. With much practice, I will understand the different 
languages like a pro. 

This is just a practice repo for myself!

Practice

Exercise 10 
Ask the user for 4 cards. If the sum equals 28 print Got it jack! 
If the sum is greater than or equal to 28 print BUST! If the sum is less than or equal to 28 print “The total is [TOTAL]”

Exercise 11 Ask the user to enter their grade. Print their letter grade:

A 90 - 100 B 80 - 89 C 70 - 79 D 60 - 69 F 0 - 59

Extra Credit: If it's negative or over 100 print an error.

Exercise 12 Ask the user to enter their age. 
Check if they entered a value between 0 and 125. If valid, print "REAL AGE". If invalid print “NOT A REAL AGE!!!”
