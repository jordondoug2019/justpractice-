# justpractice-  
Hello! Practicing using git hub and terminals. My first time seeing git hub was while researching for an online resume builder. 
I was very lost when I looked and saw a lot of words that did not make sense. With much practice, I will understand the different 
languages like a pro. 

This is just a practice repo for myself!
